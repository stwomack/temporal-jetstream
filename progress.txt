## Codebase Patterns
- Use Spring Boot 4.0.1 with Java 21 for this project
- Temporal Java SDK 1.32.1 is configured to connect to localhost:7233
- Maven wrapper (./mvnw) is used for all build commands
- Application starts on port 8080
- docker-compose.yml manages Kafka and MongoDB (NOT Temporal)
- Temporal runs via separate `temporal server start-dev` command

**What was implemented:**
- Created Spring Boot 4.0.1 project structure with Java 21
- Added Maven wrapper for consistent builds
- Created pom.xml with latest stable dependencies:
  - Spring Boot 4.0.1
  - Temporal Java SDK 1.32.1
  - Spring WebSocket for future real-time UI
  - Spring Kafka for event integration
  - MongoDB for persistence
- Created docker-compose.yml with Kafka (7.8.0) and MongoDB (8.0)
- Created Application.java with @SpringBootApplication
- Created application.yml with Temporal configuration (localhost:7233, flight-task-queue)
- Created comprehensive README.md with prerequisites and quick start

**Files changed:**
- pom.xml (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/Application.java (created)
- src/main/resources/application.yml (created)
- docker-compose.yml (created)
- README.md (created)
- mvnw, mvnw.cmd, .mvn/wrapper/* (Maven wrapper)
- .gitignore (already existed, no changes needed)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Spring Boot 4.0.1 is the latest stable version (as of January 2026)
- Spring Boot 4.0 requires Java 17 minimum but supports Java 21 and Java 25
- Had to clean up duplicate Application.java file in com.example package that was causing build failure
- ./mvnw clean install completes successfully in under 1 second (after initial dependency download)
- Application starts successfully in ~0.6 seconds and connects to MongoDB
- Temporal server must be started separately with `temporal server start-dev` (not in docker-compose)
- Task queue is configured as "flight-task-queue" for workflow operations

## 2026-01-26 14:00 - story-2

**What was implemented:**
- Created Flight domain model class with all required fields:
  - flightNumber, flightDate, departureStation, arrivalStation
  - scheduledDeparture, scheduledArrival, currentState, gate, aircraft, delay
- Created FlightState enum with all lifecycle states:
  - SCHEDULED, BOARDING, DEPARTED, IN_FLIGHT, LANDED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- Created FlightWorkflow interface with @WorkflowInterface and @WorkflowMethod annotations
- Implemented FlightWorkflowImpl with deterministic state machine:
  - Transitions through states: SCHEDULED -> BOARDING -> DEPARTED -> IN_FLIGHT -> LANDED -> COMPLETED
  - Uses Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(2)) between state transitions for simulation
  - Proper logging at each state transition
- Created TemporalConfig @Configuration class:
  - Creates WorkflowServiceStubs, WorkflowClient, WorkerFactory, and Worker beans
  - Registers FlightWorkflowImpl to 'flight-task-queue'
  - Worker starts automatically via @PostConstruct and stops via @PreDestroy
- Created comprehensive unit tests using TestWorkflowEnvironment:
  - Test with TestWorkflowExtension for simplified testing
  - Test with manual TestWorkflowEnvironment setup and WorkflowId verification
  - Both tests verify workflow completes with COMPLETED state

**Files changed:**
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/model/Flight.java (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/model/FlightState.java (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflow.java (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowImpl.java (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/config/TemporalConfig.java (created)
- src/test/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowTest.java (created)
- prd.json (updated story-2 passes: true)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Workflow implementations must be deterministic - use Workflow.sleep() not Thread.sleep()
- Use Workflow.getLogger() for logging within workflows, not standard loggers
- TestWorkflowExtension provides cleaner test setup with automatic worker registration
- WorkflowId format should be 'flight-{flightNumber}-{flightDate}' for uniqueness
- TemporalConfig uses @PostConstruct to start worker after Spring context initialization
- Worker logs 'Worker started for task queue: flight-task-queue' on successful startup
- Unit tests complete quickly (~1.3 seconds) using in-memory test server
- Application startup shows 'Registered FlightWorkflowImpl for task queue: flight-task-queue'
- FlightWorkflowImpl doesn't need @Workflow annotation (interface is sufficient)
- Flight domain model initializes with SCHEDULED state and 0 delay by default

## 2026-01-26 14:01 - story-3

**What was implemented:**
- Added three @SignalMethod annotations to FlightWorkflow interface:
  - announceDelay(int minutes) - signals flight delay
  - changeGate(String newGate) - signals gate change
  - cancelFlight(String reason) - signals flight cancellation
- Implemented signal handlers in FlightWorkflowImpl:
  - Added instance variables to track signal data (delayMinutes, currentGate, cancelled, cancellationReason)
  - announceDelay updates delayMinutes and logs the event
  - changeGate updates currentGate and logs the event
  - cancelFlight sets cancelled flag and transitions workflow to CANCELLED state
- Implemented early termination logic for cancellation:
  - Workflow checks cancelled flag after each state transition
  - When cancelled, immediately transitions to CANCELLED state and exits
- Created helper method updateFlightWithSignalData() to apply signal changes to Flight object
- Added comprehensive unit tests for signal handling:
  - testAnnounceDelaySignal - verifies delay signal updates delay field
  - testChangeGateSignal - verifies gate change signal updates gate field
  - testCancelFlightSignal - verifies cancellation terminates workflow early with CANCELLED state
  - testMultipleSignals - verifies multiple signals (delay + gate change) work together

**Files changed:**
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflow.java (added 3 signal methods)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowImpl.java (added signal handlers and cancellation logic)
- src/test/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowTest.java (added 4 signal tests)
- prd.json (updated story-3 passes: true)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Signal methods must be idempotent - safe to receive multiple times
- Signals are processed asynchronously and can arrive at any point during workflow execution
- Use workflow instance variables to store signal data (not static variables)
- Workflow.await() can be used for more sophisticated signal handling with conditions
- cancelFlight demonstrates how signals can alter workflow control flow and cause early termination
- Test signals by starting workflow asynchronously (WorkflowStub.start()) then sending signals before getting result
- TestWorkflowEnvironment makes signal testing fast (<3 seconds for all 6 tests)
- Signal handlers show up in logs with format: "Received signal: [signalName], [parameters]"
- Cancellation checks after each Workflow.sleep() ensure timely response to cancel signals

## 2026-01-26 14:02 - story-4

**What was implemented:**
- Added three @QueryMethod annotations to FlightWorkflow interface:
  - getCurrentState() - Returns current FlightState enum value
  - getFlightDetails() - Returns complete Flight object with all current data
  - getDelayMinutes() - Returns current delay in minutes (0 if not delayed)
- Implemented query methods in FlightWorkflowImpl:
  - Added currentFlight instance variable to track flight state for queries
  - getCurrentState() returns the current state from currentFlight
  - getFlightDetails() creates a new Flight object with current state plus signal data (delay, gate)
  - getDelayMinutes() returns the delayMinutes instance variable
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all query methods:
  - testGetCurrentStateQuery - Verifies state can be queried during execution
  - testGetFlightDetailsQuery - Verifies complete details can be queried, including signal changes
  - testGetDelayMinutesQuery - Verifies delay can be queried before/after signal
  - testQueriesWithSignalsIntegration - Integration test showing queries work with signals
- Updated README.md with query examples and documentation:
  - Added "Querying Flight State" section with code examples
  - Documented query methods and key features (non-blocking, read-only, real-time, consistent)

**Files changed:**
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflow.java (added 3 @QueryMethod annotations)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowImpl.java (added currentFlight variable and 3 query method implementations)
- src/test/java/com/temporal/jetstream/workflow/FlightWorkflowTest.java (added 4 new query tests)
- README.md (added "Querying Flight State" section)
- prd.json (updated story-4 passes: true)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Query methods must NOT modify workflow state - they are read-only
- Queries are synchronous and return immediately without blocking workflow execution
- Query methods return strongly consistent data with the workflow's current execution state
- getFlightDetails() creates a new Flight object to avoid returning internal mutable state
- Queries can be called on running workflows to inspect state in real-time
- Query results reflect signal changes immediately (e.g., after announceDelay signal, getDelayMinutes returns updated value)
- All 10 tests pass (6 original + 4 new query tests) in ~4.5 seconds
- TestWorkflowEnvironment makes queries execute very fast, so workflows may complete before queries in tests
- Instance variables (currentFlight, delayMinutes) are safe to use in query methods since they're accessed synchronously
- Query methods should be lightweight - no heavy computation or external calls
