## Codebase Patterns
- Use Spring Boot 4.0.1 with Java 21 for this project
- Temporal Java SDK 1.32.1 is configured to connect to localhost:7233
- Maven wrapper (./mvnw) is used for all build commands
- Application starts on port 8080
- docker-compose.yml manages Kafka and MongoDB (NOT Temporal)
- Temporal runs via separate `temporal server start-dev` command

**What was implemented:**
- Created Spring Boot 4.0.1 project structure with Java 21
- Added Maven wrapper for consistent builds
- Created pom.xml with latest stable dependencies:
  - Spring Boot 4.0.1
  - Temporal Java SDK 1.32.1
  - Spring WebSocket for future real-time UI
  - Spring Kafka for event integration
  - MongoDB for persistence
- Created docker-compose.yml with Kafka (7.8.0) and MongoDB (8.0)
- Created Application.java with @SpringBootApplication
- Created application.yml with Temporal configuration (localhost:7233, flight-task-queue)
- Created comprehensive README.md with prerequisites and quick start

**Files changed:**
- pom.xml (created)
- src/main/java/com/temporal/jetstream/Application.java (created)
- src/main/resources/application.yml (created)
- docker-compose.yml (created)
- README.md (created)
- mvnw, mvnw.cmd, .mvn/wrapper/* (Maven wrapper)
- .gitignore (already existed, no changes needed)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Spring Boot 4.0.1 is the latest stable version (as of January 2026)
- Spring Boot 4.0 requires Java 17 minimum but supports Java 21 and Java 25
- Had to clean up duplicate Application.java file in com.example package that was causing build failure
- ./mvnw clean install completes successfully in under 1 second (after initial dependency download)
- Application starts successfully in ~0.6 seconds and connects to MongoDB
- Temporal server must be started separately with `temporal server start-dev` (not in docker-compose)
- Task queue is configured as "flight-task-queue" for workflow operations
