# Temporal Jetstream - Airline Flight Lifecycle Orchestration Demo

A demonstration application showing how Temporal provides durability, reliability, scalability, and consistency for multi-day airline flight lifecycle orchestration. Complements existing Kafka/Flink streaming architecture by providing durable execution guarantees for long-running flight processes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 21** - [Download from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) or use SDKMAN
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - For running Kafka and MongoDB
- **Temporal Server** - Running locally via `temporal server start-dev`

### Installing Temporal CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install temporal

# Linux
curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh

# Windows (via Scoop)
scoop install temporal
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Temporal Server

In a separate terminal, start the Temporal development server:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This will start Temporal on `localhost:7233` with the Web UI available at `http://localhost:8233`.

### 2. Start Supporting Services

Start Kafka and MongoDB using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify services are running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### 3. Build the Application

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Web UI

The application includes an embedded web UI for real-time flight monitoring and control.

### Accessing the UI

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### UI Features

The web interface provides:

1. **Start New Flight** - Form to create new flight workflows with all required details
2. **Active Flights List** - Real-time view of all active flights with current state
3. **Flight Details Panel** - Detailed view of selected flight including:
   - Current state (SCHEDULED, BOARDING, DEPARTED, IN_FLIGHT, LANDED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
   - Route information (departure/arrival stations)
   - Gate and aircraft assignments
   - Delay information
   - Scheduled times
4. **Flight Operations** - Interactive buttons to:
   - Announce delays
   - Change gates
   - Cancel flights
5. **Event Log** - Real-time stream of flight events and state changes
6. **WebSocket Connection Status** - Indicator showing real-time connection status

### Real-time Updates

The UI uses WebSocket (STOMP over SockJS) to receive real-time updates:
- Flight state changes are pushed to the UI immediately
- No page refresh needed to see updates
- Event log shows all flight events as they occur
- Connection automatically reconnects if interrupted

### Using the UI

1. **Start a flight**: Fill in the form on the left panel and click "Start Flight"
2. **View flight status**: Flights appear in the Active Flights panel on the right
3. **Select a flight**: Click on any flight card to view detailed information
4. **Perform operations**: Use the buttons in the Flight Details panel to:
   - Click "Announce Delay" to add a delay (in minutes)
   - Click "Change Gate" to update the gate assignment
   - Click "Cancel Flight" to cancel the flight workflow
5. **Monitor events**: Watch the Event Log panel for real-time updates

## REST API Endpoints

The application provides REST endpoints to interact with flight workflows:

### Start a Flight

Start a new flight workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/flights/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "flightNumber": "AA1234",
    "flightDate": "2026-01-26",
    "departureStation": "ORD",

  -d '{"newGate": "B24"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "error": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Gate changed to B24"
}
```

### Cancel Flight

Send a cancellation signal to a running flight:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/flights/AA1234/cancel?flightDate=2026-01-26 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Weather conditions"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "error": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Flight cancelled: Weather conditions"
}
```

### Query Flight State

Get the current state of a flight:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/flights/AA1234/state?flightDate=2026-01-26
```

Response:
```json
{
  "flightNumber": "AA1234",
  "currentState": "BOARDING"
}
```

### Query Flight Details

Get complete flight details:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/flights/AA1234/details?flightDate=2026-01-26
```

Response:
```json
{

  "flightDate": "2026-01-26",
  "departureStation": "ORD",
  "arrivalStation": "DFW",
  "scheduledDeparture": "2026-01-26T10:00:00",
  "scheduledArrival": "2026-01-26T12:30:00",
  "currentState": "BOARDING",
  "gate": "B24",
  "aircraft": "N123AA",
  "delay": 45
}
```

### Error Responses

When a flight is not found:
```json
{
  "error": "WORKFLOW_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Flight not found: AA1234"
}
```

## Querying Flight State

The FlightWorkflow supports three query methods that allow you to inspect the current state of a running workflow without blocking its execution:

### Available Query Methods

1. **getCurrentState()** - Returns the current FlightState enum value
2. **getFlightDetails()** - Returns the complete Flight object with all current data
3. **getDelayMinutes()** - Returns the current delay in minutes (0 if not delayed)

### Example: Querying Flight State in Tests

```java
// Start a flight workflow
FlightWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(
    FlightWorkflow.class,
    WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
        .setTaskQueue("flight-task-queue")
        .setWorkflowId("flight-AA1234-2026-01-26")
        .build()
);

// Start workflow asynchronously
WorkflowStub.fromTyped(workflow).start(flight);

// Query current state
FlightState state = workflow.getCurrentState();
System.out.println("Current state: " + state);

// Query delay
int delay = workflow.getDelayMinutes();
System.out.println("Current delay: " + delay + " minutes");

// Query complete flight details
Flight details = workflow.getFlightDetails();
System.out.println("Flight details: " + details);

// Send a signal to update the flight
workflow.announceDelay(45);

// Query again to see the updated delay
int updatedDelay = workflow.getDelayMinutes();
System.out.println("Updated delay: " + updatedDelay + " minutes"); // Output: 45 minutes
```

### Key Features of Queries

- **Non-blocking**: Queries return immediately without affecting workflow execution
- **Read-only**: Queries cannot modify workflow state
- **Real-time**: Queries return the current state, including changes from signals
- **Consistent**: Queries are strongly consistent with the workflow's current execution state

See the test file `FlightWorkflowTest.java` for complete examples of querying workflow state.

## Failure Recovery Demonstration

One of Temporal's key value propositions is **durability** - workflows survive process restarts and continue execution from their last checkpoint. This demo includes features to showcase this capability.

### Demonstrating Temporal's Durability

The application includes a special endpoint and UI button to simulate a worker failure and demonstrate automatic recovery:

#### Via Web UI

1. Start a long-running demo flight (use flight number starting with "DEMO", e.g., "DEMO999") - these flights have 5-second delays between states for a total of ~25 seconds
2. Watch the flight progress through states: SCHEDULED → BOARDING → DEPARTED → IN_FLIGHT → LANDED → COMPLETED
3. While the flight is in progress, click the **"⚡ Simulate Failure"** button in the Active Flights panel
4. The worker will stop and restart (simulating a crash and recovery)
5. Watch the workflow automatically resume from its last checkpoint and continue to completion
6. Check the Event Log to see system messages about the restart

#### Via REST API

Trigger a worker restart programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/restart-worker
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Worker restarted successfully. Workflows will resume from last checkpoint."
}
```

### What Happens During Worker Restart

1. **Worker stops** - The Temporal worker process shuts down gracefully
2. **Workflows pause** - Active workflows pause at their last checkpoint (after completing the current activity or timer)
3. **Worker restarts** - A new worker process starts and registers with Temporal
4. **Workflows resume** - All paused workflows automatically continue from their last checkpoint
5. **No data loss** - All workflow state, variables, and history are preserved

### Application Logs During Recovery

You'll see logs similar to this:

```
INFO  - Stopping worker to simulate failure...
INFO  - Worker stopped
INFO  - Restarting worker...
INFO  - Registered FlightWorkflowImpl and MultiLegFlightWorkflowImpl for task queue: flight-task-queue
INFO  - Worker restarted. Workflows will resume from last checkpoint.
INFO  - Flight DEMO999 is IN_FLIGHT (continues after restart)
```

### Key Durability Features Demonstrated

- **Workflow State Persistence**: All workflow variables and execution state are preserved
- **Signal History Preservation**: Signals sent before the restart (delays, gate changes) are retained
- **Query Availability**: You can query workflow state even during and after restart
- **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention needed - workflows just continue
- **No Duplicate Execution**: Workflow logic doesn't re-execute completed steps

### Testing Failure Recovery

The project includes automated tests that simulate worker restarts:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=FailureRecoveryTest
```

These tests verify:
- Workflows complete successfully after worker restart
- Workflow history is preserved across restarts
- Signals sent before restart are retained

### Why This Matters

In production airline systems:
- **Worker crashes** are inevitable (OOM, hardware failures, deployments)
- **Long-running processes** (multi-hour flights) must survive restarts
- **Critical state** (gate assignments, delays, passenger counts) cannot be lost
- **Business continuity** requires workflows to resume automatically

Temporal's durability guarantee means you can deploy new code, restart workers, or recover from failures without losing track of in-flight operations.
